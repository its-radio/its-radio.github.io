	abstract = {Supreme Court advocate Pavan Duggal tells everything about cyber law from its 'then' to 'now' to what it needs to be. 

Mr. Pavan Duggal is practicing advocate at Supreme Court of India with a specialization in Cyber Law and E-Commerce law. His never-ending effort in these fields have earned him the reputation of an expert, both in the National and in the International domain.  
An internationally renowned expert and authority on Cyber law, Mr. Duggal has also the credit of having done pioneering work in the field of Convergence Law and Mobile Law.  
He was also the first person from Asia-Pacific who brought to light the need to address the issue of cyber terrorism at the AMIC Conference at Perth, Australia in 2002.  
Mr. Duggal strongly believes that “a dedicated cyber security legislation as a key requirement for India. It is not sufficient to merely put cyber security as a part of the IT Act. We have to see cyber security not only from the sectoral perspective, but also from the national perspective."

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx},
