**! Notes:**
1. *The CDSA exam includes a pretty tight statement of confidentiality. I will not be violating any terms of that statement in this article.*
2. *I have completed all coursework associated with the CDSA course as of December 2024. I completed and passed the exam in January 2025. I cannot speak to any changes in the course that may have taken place after that time.*

# Introduction {#intro}

After a few years of teaching myself cybersecurity skills alongside a full time job in another field and then a year getting a masters degree in cyber security, the CDSA course and exam stand out as exceptional experiences. I would recommend this certification for anyone considering a career in defensive security.

Launched in September of 2023, the [CDSA (Certified Defensive Security Analyst)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst) is a fairly new certification offered by Hack The Box Academy. It is one of [five main certifications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications) offered by the platform, and the the only defensive certification among those five.
