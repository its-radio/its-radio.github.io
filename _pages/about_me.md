In 2017, I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout the next 7 years, I gained experience in mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering. Around 2022, I discovered the world of cybersecurity when I began reading about crypto heists, nation-state threats, and the crimes committed by various "coms". Andy Greenberg's books *Sandworm* and *Tracers In The Dark* were especially formative for me in making the decision to pursue cybersecurity. As I became more familiar with the field from an outside perspective, I couldn't help but feel the desire to become an insider. Every time I read a book about information security, watched a DefCon talk on YouTube, or read an article about some new ransomware strain, I felt a palpable desire to be a part of that world. Then, one day I ran across Jack Rhysider's [The Art Of Solving Novel Problems in IT Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGP1Tm8xyPI). He describes how in IT security, you're not just solving problems, but solving *novel* problems, and that as an information security practitioner, that's the skill that you're really trying to hone: being able to solve problems that you--and maybe no one--has ever seen before. I knew right then, that's what I wanted to do with my life.

After a good deal of planning and learning about IT and security alongside my full-time engineering job, I decided to take the plunge and go back to school. I quit my job and started a master’s program at Southern Utah University, which was conveniently located in the town I was living in at the time (though I have since moved out of the state). I graduated with a Masters degree in Cybersecurity in fall 2024, and since then I have been job hunting and figuring out what to do now that I have made this monumental shift.

The degree program was a great official introduction to the world of infosec on the theoretical side, but fairly light on any technical training. I had already self-taught some technical skills, but I wanted to be sure I’d measure up in the industry. Because of that I decided to get a technical certification.

I decided to go for the Hack The Box's Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA) because of its focus on practical, hands-on learning and testing. Each lesson includes live demos and problems that the students must solve before being eligible to take the exam. The exam consists of a 7-day-long simulated incident response in which the student must investigate and report on two separate security incidents. I loved this course, especially the exam. In my educational journey so far, the CDSA exam was the most interesting and engaging challenge I’ve encountered. Though the exam was only a week long, it truly gave me a sense of what it will be like to work in a SOC, and all I want now is more of that feeling.
