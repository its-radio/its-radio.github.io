Hey everyone, I'm Radio.

**TL;DR:** I am a newly minted infosec professional trying to learn, share my experiences, and hopefully help others learn along the way. Check out my blog for summaries of lessons, CTFs, and my thoughts about the infosec world.

**The Longer Version:**

I used to be an engineer. No, not the IT kind, the building-with-physical stuff kind. After 7 years in the field, I decided I wanted a more meaningful career. Meaning is a loaded word, but here it means that I wanted a career that required me to learn new things and [solve novel problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGP1Tm8xyPI).

I graduated with a Masters degree in Cybersecurity in August 2024, and since then I have been job hunting and figuring out what to do now that I have made this monumental shift. Now I have a problem. I have a degree, but I don't have any real-world experience. Sure, I have studied some hard skills in IT and security and I run some small-scale IT infrastructure at home, but my degree was more on the theoretical side than the practical.

Too late, I learned that certifications might have been a better track for me than the masters degree. I considered both before jumping into the degree, but at the time academia sounded better than industry certs. C'est la vie. The masters was a great way to dive into the field and get a wholistic understanding of the space. That being said, now its time for some certifications, starting with HackTheBox's Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA). I plan for notes and lesson summaries on that to make up the bulk of my early posts here.

Later, I'd like to share other sorts of content like CTF guides, breach analyses, and more. Stay tuned for more on those topics.
