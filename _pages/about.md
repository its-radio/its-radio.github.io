#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`.

## My story

### TL;DR

I am a Mechanical & Civil Engineer turned infosec professional trying to continually increase my knowledge in the field, share my experiences, and hopefully help others learn along the way. I graduated in fall 2024 with a master's in Cybersecurity and in early 2025 earned the Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA) certification from Hack The Box. Now, I'm searching for jobs while also working toward Hack The Box's Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (CBBH).

If you're hiring for any roles in Information Security, especially SOC Analysis or Incident Response, and you like what you see on my blog, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmundhughes/).

### The Longer Version
Find it in the <a href="/people/">People section</a>.

On this blog, Iâ€™ll share content related to my learning journey like CTF writeups, breach analyses, research and more. Stay tuned for more on those topics.
